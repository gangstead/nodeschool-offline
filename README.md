nodeschool-offline
==================

Offline site for NodeSchool.io events that includes zipped workshoppers and instructions.  Host your instructions and downloads from a laptop to avoid hammering a shared internet connection.

Fork for [Nodeschool Dallas](https://github.com/nodeschool/dallas) meetups.

## Setup

First time you want to run you need to download all the dependencies.  Will have to do this again whenever you add a module.
```
> npm install
```

## Running

The default gulp task opens a web server at port 3000
```
> gulp
```
Then visit http://localhost:3000
Find your local ip address with 'ifconfig' (mac) or 'ipconfig' (windows)
