These instructions assume you have already installed
NodeJS & NPM on your computer.

Download and unzip the workshop you'd like to work on.

Once unzipped, open your terminal program (Windows users -- open as administrator)
and change directory to your workshop.

To install this workshop's program,
simply run this command:

Windows:
> npm link

Linux/Mac users:
> sudo npm link

If you're working on the Learn You Node workshop,
your computer will now have a 'learnyounode' program you
can run from the terminal.
