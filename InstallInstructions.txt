Installing Node.

Download the Node binary for your system.  Go through the installer.


Windows Users:
There's a bug in the current windows installer.  You must follow two additional steps:
1) Run cmd as an administrator
2) Create this folder:

  mkdir 'C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\npm

Or else you will get this error:

  Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\npm
